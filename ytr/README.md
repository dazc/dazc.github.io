READ ME files exist for completion for proof of concept
Concept: Given a youtube url, autoplay an infinite loop of that video

TODO:
# Input
	Accept full or partial address identifying 11 characters after "v="
	Accept entire playlist

# Nonfunctional
	Build a history list
	Limit list items
	Retain list items based on session

# Decorative
	Fix all the things
	Change hover link color (bright red annoyance but close)
	Consider other fonts for non-headers (Trebuchet, Comic Sans, Wingdings)
	Do a proper navbar ("Go Back" is so basic it buys pumpkin spice lattes)
	Generate better markers than IDs for the list? (w/o breaking things)
