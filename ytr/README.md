Concept: Given a youtube url, autoplay an infinite loop of that video

[https://dazc.github.io/ytr/](https://dazc.github.io/ytr/ "Click to begin")

#TODO:
---
## Input
	Accept full or partial address identifying 11 characters after "v=" (done)
	Accept entire playlist (ehh..)
	Allow substituting "youtube.com/" with "dazc.github.io/ytr/" for ease (really far off)

## Nonfunctional
	Build a history list (do it better)
	Limit list items (done)
	Retain list items based on session (...eventually, sure)

## Decorative
	Fix all the things (undefined error)
	Change hover link color (The red hover isn't so bad on black)
	Consider other fonts for non-headers (Trebuchet, Comic Sans, Wingdings)
	Do a proper navbar ("Go Back" is so basic it buys pumpkin spice lattes)
	Generate better markers than IDs for the list? (w/o breaking things)

## Problems (greatest to least)
	List items can repeat (Such is the cycle of life? Will fix after philosophical thought)
	Added list items aren't clickable (fixed but note: event delegation necessary for dynamics)
	Clearing text fields (fixed via enmarkup scripting cuz I'm a scrub)
	Mobile support? (Hahahahahahahahahahahah)	
	
## Learn anything about HTML/CSS/JS?
- How to scrub my way to victory
- Event delegation handles dynamic html
- I have really bad taste in music
- Everything here has nice reuse, 10/10 will rip from self
- [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) is heavenly for troubleshooting
- [caniuse.com](caniuse.com) is a nice resource, probably
- I can probably break more things than I can fix which is still a talent in some programming loops
