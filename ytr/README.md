READ ME file exists to mark functional completion for proof of concept and list future objectives.

Concept: Given a youtube url, autoplay an infinite loop of that video

#TODO:
#___
## Input
	~~Accept full or partial address identifying 11 characters after "v="~~
	Accept entire playlist
	Allow substituting "youtube" with "dazc.github.com/ytr/" for ease

## Nonfunctional
	Build a history list (until I convince myself why I shouldn't)
	Limit list items (This one's actually simple, I just haven't given it thought since I'm ready to move on to other projects)
	Retain list items based on session (this whole sections going to happen last)

## Decorative
	Fix all the things
	Change hover link color (bright red annoyance but close)
	Consider other fonts for non-headers (Trebuchet, Comic Sans, Wingdings)
	Do a proper navbar ("Go Back" is so basic it buys pumpkin spice lattes)
	Generate better markers than IDs for the list? (w/o breaking things)

## Problems (greatest to least)
	Added list items aren't clickable
	List items can repeat
	No limit on list items (make it 5)
