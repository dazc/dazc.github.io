READ ME file exists to mark functional completion for proof of concept and list future objectives.

Concept: Given a youtube url, autoplay an infinite loop of that video

#TODO:
___
## Input
	Accept full or partial address identifying 11 characters after "v="
	Accept entire playlist
	Allow substituting "youtube.com/" with "dazc.github.io/ytr/" for ease

## Nonfunctional
	Build a history list (until I convince myself why I shouldn't)
	Limit list items
	Retain list items based on session (this whole sections going to happen last)

## Decorative
	Fix all the things (undefined error)
	Change hover link color (bright red annoyance but close -> ok with bg)
	Consider other fonts for non-headers (Trebuchet, Comic Sans, Wingdings)
	Do a proper navbar ("Go Back" is so basic it buys pumpkin spice lattes)
	Generate better markers than IDs for the list? (w/o breaking things...lol oh well)

## Problems (greatest to least)
	List items can repeat (Such is the cycle of life? Will fix after philosophical thought)
	Added list items aren't clickable (fixed but note event delegation for dynamics)
